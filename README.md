War Card Game Using Swift and SwifUI

War Card Game is the most interesting game in our generation. It will be more fun to play this game But here I made this game in the app format 

1. The interesting War Card Game where i added some interesting images of cards and it will be more fun by playing this game online by our phone
2. we can play here with the computer and added the couters of win i.e how many times the player is winning and 
how many times times the computer is winning the game 
3. we are used the random cards for both the computer and user thats why there is no chances for making the game bised on 
individual side its totally fairby making the random card generator 
4. Technology Stack : 
  Swift and SwiftUI
  
here you can see the images 
This is my one of the bigginer level project to reach the goal to be a Native IOS developer... 
you can refer this and make some contribute and learn some new things if you are also a bigginer like me. 
keep coding... Happy learning ..!!
